# PDFextractor
I use this project to extract data about student related information,and convert them to a visualized excel which arrange them in a proper way in a csv file,as for attchments in pdf,I put their paths in the excel.
And this extractor will sets up new folders as student folder and examiner folder to save attachments in pdf of test_files and convert them into a new txt file seperately.
In the student folder,just use number to distinguish different students.
In the examiner,given that different students may have the same tutor,check the scanning order of pdfextractor and still use number to differentiate tutor information of students.when it comes to the same tutor,file name with an bigger number will cover the smaller one.
